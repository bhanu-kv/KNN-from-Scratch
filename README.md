# KNN-from-Scratch

KNN algorithm is a simple algorithm used for both Regression and Classification which I have built from scratch without using any pre-built libraries like sci-pi and scikit learn, it is one of the most intutive algorithm which is easier to understand and explain.

## About

There are large varieties of options to choose as a metric; however, I chose to go forward with Euclidean Distance as an example, which is used to calculate the Distance between vectors.

Also, there are multiple methods you can go forward with, but I have chosen Brute Force which has a time complexity of O(n*m) where n is the number of test data points and m is the number of training Data Points. We can chose forward to go with multiple dimensions of Data Points, but I have selected 2-Dimensional data as it is easy to visualize and explain.

## Results

The accuracy of test data turned out to be 0.95 for the best value of k, which is pretty good. The visualization of the Decision Boundary is given below.
